A sample code that centers the HUD for DOOM3 BFG under Ubuntu OS on nVidia Surround.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It only works with the build created from the Released Doom3BFG found here:
https://github.com/RobertBeckebans/RBDOOM-3-BFG
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

!!!! Please follow all the instructions there in order to make the game work under Linux.

Based on the compiler used. the Layout of the executable might be different. 
If this is the case use the file found in "Game_Binary" folder(it was built on Ubuntu using the latest gcc and support for 32-bits)
